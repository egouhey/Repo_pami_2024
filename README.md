## 📄 This project in short

I developed this small robot in collaboration with one of my classmates to participate in the 2024 edition of the French Robotics Cup as a PAMI : a small robot that must move quickly on the table. It is equipped with an ESP32, DC micro motors, and ultrasonic sensors. We also designed a PCB for interconnecting all these components.
